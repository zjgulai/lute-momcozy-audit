# Lute Momcozy Audit

Private-business technical and operating audit of the Momcozy storefront — also a periodic performance monitoring product.

**Production**: https://shopify.lute-tlz-dddd.top
**Release contract**: private-business (`docs/release-contract.md`)
**Last session**: 2026-06-14 (automated, route-aware)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm ci
npm test        # build + schema + source safety + sessions + build safety + links + e2e + a11y
npm run test:competitor-plan # validate competitor recollect statuses and task execution plan
npm run release:checklist # generate a pre-release evidence checklist in artifacts/
npm run test:release-parity   # optional pre-release local-vs-production structure parity check
npm run serve   # local preview at http://localhost:8080
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- Chromium (installed automatically by `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`)

## Pages

| Canonical route | Generated from | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `scripts/build-history-site.mjs` | Overview — private-business storyline, operating KPIs, evidence chain, and execution plan |
| `/metrics.html` | `scripts/build-history-site.mjs` | Metrics — operating KPI caveats plus route-aware technical metrics |
| `/forensics.html` | `scripts/build-history-site.mjs` | Forensics — evidence trail, third-party failure analysis, and audit limits |
| `/trends.html` | `scripts/build-history-site.mjs` | Trends — latest route-aware collection and methodology caveats |
| `/cross-audit.html` | `scripts/build-history-site.mjs` | Cross-audit — contradictions, final audit, strategy matrix, and execution orders |
| `/404.html` | `scripts/build-history-site.mjs` | Not-found page |

Slashless aliases such as `/metrics`, `/forensics`, and `/trends` may work through the local/static server. The `.html` routes above are the source-of-truth routes for documentation, testing, and release identity checks.

## Data Architecture

### Active build source

`scripts/build-history-site.mjs` is the production build entrypoint. It reads `src/_data/public-cross-audit.json`, combines it with the latest session file, copies `history_static/assets/`, and writes `_site/`.

Legacy Eleventy templates are still present for historical context, but they are not the active production build path.

### public-cross-audit.json — private-business report source

This is the current generated-site source for the private-business edition. It may include real amounts, real KPI labels, historical operating data, current operating data, collection data, and function-comparison conclusions approved by the owner.

### audit.json — technical snapshot validation source

`src/_data/audit.json` remains schema-validated and is used by validation scripts to keep latest technical findings aligned with the newest automated session.

### sessions/ — time-series archive for Trends

One JSON file per collection run (`YYYY-MM-DD.json`). The latest collection session is
resolved by `scripts/build-history-site.mjs` from `observedAt` and then fed through schema checks and threshold/route adapters.

**Session format v2** (from 2026-06-10): dual viewport, new metrics (TBT, DOM nodes, JS KB, total requests), mobile block, auto-computed confidence.

**Session format v3 route aggregate** (next automated collection): preserves the v2 top-level homepage fields for the existing Trends page, and also adds `methodologyVersion` plus a `routes[]` array. Routes are defined in `config/collection-routes.json` and currently cover homepage plus one representative product-detail route. Each route stores desktop and mobile aggregate metrics only; raw request URLs are not persisted.

**Session format v1** (before 2026-05-17): manual browser, no mobile block, confidence: low. Not directly comparable to v2.

## Updating Audit Data

### Manual snapshot update

1. Edit `src/_data/audit.json`
2. `npm run test:allowlist` — validate schema
3. `npm run test:competitor-plan` — verify `public-cross-audit.json` competitor recollect status/task plan integrity
4. `npm test` — full suite
5. Commit and push

### Add a new session (manual)

```bash
AUDIT_TARGET_URL=https://momcozy.com npm run collect
npm run test:sessions
npm test
```

For local collector smoke tests, use `AUDIT_ROUTE_CONFIG`, `AUDIT_OUTPUT_DIR`, and `AUDIT_SESSION_DATE` to write a temporary session outside `src/_data/sessions/`.

### Add a new session (scheduled CI)

`collect.yml` runs automatically on the 1st of each month at 02:00 UTC.
Requires GitHub Secret: `AUDIT_TARGET_URL=https://momcozy.com`

## Safety Scan

`npm run test:release-contract` verifies that the generated `_site/` matches the private-business release identity.

`npm run test:source-safety` scans publication inputs for still-forbidden patterns before deployment.

`npm run test:safety` scans `_site/` for still-forbidden patterns: private paths, server addresses, private keys, and raw private endpoint patterns.

`npm run test:release-parity` compares local built artifacts against production pages for:
- required section anchors and sidebar anchors,
- minimum section content quality,
- empty tables inside required sections.

It also accepts:
- `RELEASE_PARITY_REPORT_PATH`: writes a JSON report for CI evidence (for example `artifacts/release-parity-<sha>.json`).
- `RELEASE_PARITY_SECTIONS`: when set to `0`, the report excludes per-section component states. Default is enabled.

Private-business edition allows real operating amounts and KPI labels in generated report pages. It still forbids secrets, private filesystem paths, server addresses, and raw data endpoint references.

## Current Roadmap

The active optimization roadmap is tracked in `docs/optimization-todo.md`.
Batch 1-15 are implemented.

The active release-consistency debt plan is tracked in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-debt-release-consistency-governance.md`.

## Review Workflow

Monthly CI collection builds a PR with an auto-generated summary at `.github/collect-summary.md`
(`npm run collect:summary`), including:

- methodology/version summary,
- threshold status for the latest automated session,
- review checklist for methodology shifts and sensitive-content gates.

For manual review of data-only PRs and release-note conventions, follow `docs/review-workflow.md`.

## Deployment

### Pre-release evidence checklist

Before pushing a release branch or `main`, run:

```bash
npm run release:checklist
```

The command writes a Markdown evidence package under `artifacts/` with:

- current branch and commit,
- latest session and release-contract context,
- full local `npm test` status,
- local-vs-production release parity status,
- production uptime / route-contract status,
- a release-note draft and manual deploy checklist.

Use `npm run release:checklist -- --quick` when you only need a lightweight local gate before deeper CI validation. Optional flags:

- `--skip-parity`: skip production structure parity.
- `--skip-monitor`: skip production uptime checks.
- `RELEASE_CHECKLIST_PUBLIC_URL`: override the production URL.
- `RELEASE_CHECKLIST_OUTPUT`: write the checklist to a specific Markdown path.

### GitHub Pages (automatic)
Push to `main` → `pages.yml` builds, tests, and deploys.

### Tencent Cloud (automatic)
Push to `main` → `tencent.yml` (build+test job → deploy job via artifact, no duplicate testing).

Required repository secrets:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` | SSH private key for the deploy user |
| `DEPLOY_HOST` | Tencent Cloud host configured as a repository secret |
| `DEPLOY_ROOT` | `/opt/momcozy-audit` |
| `DEPLOY_USER` | `ubuntu` |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | `https://shopify.lute-tlz-dddd.top` |
| `AUDIT_TARGET_URL` | `https://momcozy.com` |

## Competitor recollect plan checks

竞品复采计划使用 `src/_data/public-cross-audit.json` 中的 `competitorMatrix` 与 `competitorRecollectPlan` 两类数据支撑。
`npm run test:competitor-plan` 会对以下内容做约束：

- `competitorMatrix[*].recollectStatus` 的结构与状态值（`todo` / `pending` / `in_progress` / `blocked` / `done`）校验
- 计划任务 `competitorRecollectPlan.tasks` 的字段完整性、任务 ID 去重、状态值
- `commands` 字段为非空字符串列表（如有）

本仓库的 `npm test` 已将该校验固化到统一管道，避免“网站结构正常、但任务台账未闭环”的发布风险。

### External uptime monitoring (outside GitHub Actions)

Use `scripts/uptime-monitor.mjs` with `npm run monitor:uptime` on a separate host or VM:

```bash
cd /path/to/lute-momcozy-audit
PUBLIC_URL=https://shopify.lute-tlz-dddd.top npm run monitor:uptime
```

Recommended `cron` entry for a 5-minute heartbeat (append to crontab):

```text
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/lute-momcozy-audit && PUBLIC_URL=https://shopify.lute-tlz-dddd.top npm run monitor:uptime >> logs/uptime.log 2>&1
```

Production cron template: `ops/uptime-cron.example`.

Optional environment flags:

- `UPTIME_STRICT=1`: enforce non-blocking checks from soft warnings (security headers / noindex / max RTT) as hard failures.
- `UPTIME_TIMEOUT_MS=10000`: per-probe timeout.
- `UPTIME_MAX_RTT_MS=5000`: maximum acceptable request time.
- `UPTIME_REQUIRE_NOINDEX=1`: noindex check must pass or script exits non-zero.
- `UPTIME_CHECKS_JSON='[{"name":"home","paths":["/"],"expectedStatus":[200],"requireSecurityHeaders":true}]'`: override check set.
- `UPTIME_EXPECT_TITLE_CONTAINS`: optional homepage title marker to verify target identity.
- `UPTIME_EXPECT_BODY_MARKERS`: comma-separated list or JSON array that overrides the default homepage identity markers (`路特 AI`, `Momcozy`, `私密经营`).
- `UPTIME_EXPECT_HOME_SHA256`: optional homepage body SHA256 checksum for deploy identity.
- `UPTIME_FETCH_RETRIES`: number of fetch attempts per request when the network call fails (default: `1`).
- `UPTIME_FETCH_RETRY_DELAY_MS`: delay in milliseconds between retry attempts (default: `500`).
- `UPTIME_LOG_FILE`: JSON line-delimited output path.
- `UPTIME_WEBHOOK_URL`: optional webhook endpoint for failures.
- `UPTIME_WEBHOOK_KIND`: `json` (default), `feishu`, `dingtalk`, `slack`.
- `UPTIME_NOTIFY_WARNINGS=1`: include warning-only states in webhook notifications.
- `UPTIME_ALERT_STATE_FILE`: optional persistent alert state path (default: `.uptime-monitor-state.json`).
- `UPTIME_ALERT_STATE_WRITE_RETRIES`: alert-state write attempts for transient filesystem errors (default: `3`).
- `UPTIME_FAILURE_SUPPRESS_HOURS`: failure dedupe window in hours (default: `1`).
- `UPTIME_WARNING_SUPPRESS_HOURS`: warning dedupe window in hours (default: `24`).
- `UPTIME_WARNING_ESCALATE_COUNT`: number of warning runs to trigger escalation within the escalation window (default: `3`).
- `UPTIME_WARNING_ESCALATE_WINDOW_HOURS`: window size for warning escalation in hours (default: `24`).
- `UPTIME_ALERT_STATE_TTL_DAYS`: alert-state retention window in days (default: `14`).
- `UPTIME_ALERT_STATE_MAX_ENTRIES`: number of in-memory issue keys to retain in state file (default: `300`).

You can also run monitor contract tests locally:

```bash
npm run test:uptime-monitor
```

To aggregate notification delivery failures from a JSONL monitor log:

```bash
npm run monitor:notify-summary -- logs/monitor-results.log
```

To dry-run validate the production cron template without network requests:

```bash
npm run test:uptime-cron
```

Detailed usage and alerting expectations are in `docs/uptime-monitoring.md`.

### Tencent Cloud — production nginx

The site is served by the shared `ai_video_nginx` container.
Files live at `/opt/momcozy-audit/html/` (mounted as `/var/www/momcozy-audit` in the container).
nginx config: `/opt/ai-video/deploy/lighthouse/nginx.conf` — the `shopify.lute-tlz-dddd.top` server block.

**Do not edit `ops/nginx/momcozy-audit.conf` as a production operation** — it is a reference copy only.
